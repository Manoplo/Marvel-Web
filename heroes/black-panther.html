                        <p> T'Challa is the King of Wakanda and the eldest child of T'Chaka and Ramonda. As the Wakandan
                            monarch, he became the holder of the Black Panther mantle. Following the death of his father
                            in the bombing attack orchestrated by Helmut Zemo, T'Challa had set out to kill the Winter
                            Soldier, who was widely believed to be responsible for the attack. During his attempt to
                            find the Winter Soldier, Black Panther had joined a Civil War between the Avengers, where he
                            sided with Iron Man. However, Black Panther eventually learned that Zemo was really the one
                            who had been responsible for his father's demise, as he captured Zemo, handing him over to
                            Everett Ross, while he also vowed never to allow desires of vengeance to consume him again.
