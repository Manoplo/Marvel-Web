                        <p> Johann Schmidt is the former head of HYDRA, the special weapons division of the Nazi
                            Schutzstaffel and a modern-day incarnation of the ancient society. Having become a confidant
                            of Adolf Hitler during World War II, Schmidt gained ambitions to become the superior man,
                            leading him to test the version of Abraham Erskine's Super Soldier Serum on himself,
                            resulting with him becoming hideously disfigured as well as gaining the name of Red Skull.
                            While he led HYDRA, Red Skull had found the Tesseract which he had believed could help him
                            to control the world. However, Red Skull's plans were challenged by the Allies' only super
                            soldier, Captain America, who destroyed the HYDRA facilities. Once Red Skull had launched
                            his offensive, intending to bring the United States down onto its knees, he was intercepted
                            by Captain America and then vanished into a wormhole as he touched the Tesseract with his
                            bare hands.</p>
