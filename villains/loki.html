                        <h5>Bio:</h5>

                        <p> Loki Laufeyson was the biological son of Laufey, the ruler of the Frost Giants in Jotunheim,
                            who was abandoned and left to die shortly after his birth. Found by Odin, Loki was taken to
                            Asgard and raised by him and Frigga as an Asgardian prince, along with Thor. When Thor was
                            to be crowned King, Loki had sabotaged the coronation by letting the Frost Giants attack
                            Asgard, thus leading Thor to seek vengeance on Jotunheim, which resulted in Thor's
                            banishment to Earth and Loki finding out the truth about his heritage. Frigga gave Loki the
                            throne when Odin had fallen into the Odinsleep; however, when the Warriors Three and Sif
                            attempted to return Thor home, Loki was forced to try to stop them. Regardless, Thor
                            returned from his exile on Earth and ended Loki's reign, thwarting his attempt to declare
                            war on the Nine Realms with Jotunheim's destruction. With Odin disapproving of his actions,
                            Loki allowed himself to fall through the deep abyss of space, entering a wormhole created by
                            the sudden termination of the Bifrost Bridge.</p>
