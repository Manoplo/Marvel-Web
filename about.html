                <article class="col-md-6">

                    <p>Marvel Comics, American media and entertainment company that was widely regarded as one of the
                        “big
                        two” publishers in the comic industry. Its parent company, Marvel Entertainment, is a wholly
                        owned
                        subsidiary of the Disney Company. Its headquarters are in New York City.</p>
                    <p>The precursor to Marvel Comics was founded in 1939 by pulp magazine publisher Martin Goodman. In
                        order to capitalize on the growing popularity of comic books—especially those starring
                        superheroes—Goodman created Timely Comics. Timely’s first comic book was Marvel Comics no. 1
                        (cover
                        dated October 1939), which featured several superhero characters, most notably the Human Torch
                        and
                        the Sub-Mariner. Timely Comics introduced many superhero characters during comics’ “Golden Age”
                        in
                        the 1940s, most importantly Captain America, who first appeared in Captain America Comics no. 1
                        (March 1941). Timely characters were often portrayed as fighting against the Nazis and the
                        Japanese
                        even before the United States entered World War II. As the 1940s came to a close, superheroes
                        fell
                        out of vogue with comic book readers, and Timely canceled the last of its books in this genre in
                        1950. In 1951 Goodman formed his own distribution company, and Timely Comics became Atlas
                        Magazines.
                        Though there was a brief experiment in bringing back superheroes such as Captain America in
                        1953,
                        Atlas’s output was mostly in other genres such as humour, westerns, horror, war, and science
                        fiction.

                        In 1956 rival company DC Comics ushered in the so-called Silver Age of comics by reintroducing
                        superhero titles with significant commercial success. In the early 1960s Atlas changed its name
                        to
                        Marvel Comics. For several decades Marvel and DC were the top companies in the industry.
                        Throughout
                        the 1980s and ’90s Marvel changed hands numerous times, becoming a publicly held company in
                        1991.
                        Questionable management decisions and a general slump in sales in the comic book industry drove
                        Marvel Comics into bankruptcy in 1996. The company emerged from bankruptcy in 1998 and began to
                        diversify its output, launching imprints aimed at a variety of demographics and expanding its
                        cinematic offerings under the Marvel Studios banner. In 2007 Marvel began publishing digital
                        comics.
                        In 2009 the Walt Disney Company purchased the parent company of Marvel Comics.</p>

                <section class="col">
                    <p>
                        The shared storytelling palette known as the Marvel universe was unveiled in 1961, when Goodman
                        responded to the growing interest in superhero books by commissioning writer Stan Lee and artist
                        Jack Kirby to create the Fantastic Four. With the release of Fantastic Four no. 1 (November
                        1961), readers were introduced to a superheroic setting that was, nevertheless, rooted in the
                        real world. Lee and Kirby attempted to make their comic book characters more original by
                        allowing them to interact with each other in a realistic fashion, including heroes often
                        fighting or arguing with each other. This trend continued with a flood of other superhero
                        characters introduced by Marvel Comics during the early 1960s, including Spider-Man, the
                        Incredible Hulk, and the X-Men. Lee wrote the majority of Marvel’s books during that time, and
                        Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko were the most important and influential artists.

                                This more realistic approach to characterizations built up Marvel’s reputation and began
                                to attract university-age readers. Stories also began to deal with social issues such as
                                pollution, race relations, and drug abuse. A Spider-Man story arc from 1971 dealing with
                                drug abuse had to be published without the approval of the Comic Code Authority—the
                                self-regulatory body that had policed comic content since 1954—despite the fact that it
                                was portraying drug use in a negative light. This caused the Comic Code Authority to
                                revise its policy in such matters.

                                The late 1960s and early 1970s saw a new generation of creative talent emerge at Marvel.
                                In 1967 Jim Steranko began to write and draw stories featuring secret agent Nick Fury in
                                the anthology book Strange Tales. Steranko was influenced in his work by James Bond
                                films and the psychedelic and Op art movements, and the resulting stories melded
                                groundbreaking visuals with equally innovative storytelling techniques. Writer Chris
                                Claremont and artist John Byrne began a long collaboration on The Uncanny X-Men in 1975.
                                The pair revitalized the flagging series with characters such as Wolverine and complex
                                story arcs that soon made the X-Men franchise one of Marvel’s best sellers.

                                In 1985 Mark Gruenwald started a critically acclaimed 10-year run as the writer of
                                Captain America. That same year he also began the miniseries Squadron Supreme (1985–86),
                                a deconstructionist take on superheroes that preceded Alan Moore’s graphic novel
                                Watchmen, published by DC Comics. The 1980s also saw Frank Miller’s stint on Daredevil,
                                which took that book in a darker and grittier direction, reviving sagging sales and
                                making it one of Marvel’s best sellers. In 1988 Todd MacFarlane began a popular run as
                                artist on The Amazing Spider-Man. Four years later MacFarlane and a number of other
                                popular artists, including Jim Lee, Erik Larsen, and Rob Liefeld, left Marvel to found
                                rival Image Comics, a company that allowed creators to retain the copyrights of their
                                characters.

                                During the 1990s and early 2000s a new wave of writers, including Brian Michael Bendis
                                (Daredevil, The Avengers), Jonathan Hickman (Fantastic Four), and Ed Brubaker (Captain
                                America), became well known for their mature and sometimes controversial takes on
                                Marvel’s characters. The 2010s saw the emergence of another new wave of talent, with
                                writer Matt Fraction and artist David Aja turning in a visually arresting run on
                                Hawkeye, longtime Spider-Man writer Dan Slott teaming with artist Mike Allred for a bold
                                take on a classic character in Silver Surfer, and writer G. Willow Wilson and artist
                                Adrian Alphona breaking new ground with their critically acclaimed Ms. Marvel.

                        In the 21st century Marvel’s profits were increasingly derived from toys, video games, and
                        other merchandise featuring their most popular characters and from the production of a
                        string of commercially successful movies. Those films differed from prior efforts to
                        translate comics to the big screen in that they were set in a single shared world. That
                        ambitious plan generated huge dividends with The Avengers (2012), a film that featured Iron
                        Man, Thor, and Captain America—three heroes that had scored individual blockbuster
                        successes—and grossed more than $1.5 billion worldwide. The Marvel Cinematic Universe, as it
                        came to be known, grew into one of the most lucrative franchises in film history. Its
                        success spawned a wave of television programs, beginning with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.
                        (2013–20) on ABC and continuing with Daredevil (2015–18), Jessica Jones (2015–19), and Luke
                        Cage (2016–18), a string of critically lauded series that appeared on Netflix. In 2015 an
                        agreement between Disney and Sony brought Spider-Man (who had previously appeared only in
                        Sony-produced films) into the shared universe; the character would subsequently be available
                        for use by both studios. Marvel Studios, the company’s film and television division,
                        continued to set records with its flagship Avengers, but it also packed theatres with
                        relatively unknown heroes such as the Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), Ant-Man (2015), and
                        Doctor Strange (2016). In addition, Black Panther (2018) became the first Marvel movie to
                        win an Academy Award; it received Oscars for costume design, original score, and production
                        design. By 2020 more than 20 films had been released under the banner of the Marvel
                        Cinematic Universe, and the franchise’s cumulative global box office receipts had topped $22
                        billion.
